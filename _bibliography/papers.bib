abstract="The medical industry is one of the biggest victims of unavailability and lack of variety of data. Despite sizable medical data being available across the world, privacy norms prevent it from being shared. Adding variety to data is impossible without an efficient, privacy-preserving approach to enable data use from multiple sources. This lack of variety in data leads to extremely biased machine learning models. Cancer data, like data of many other diseases, is multivariate and demands personalized treatment protocols, showing importance of the variety that data from multiple sources can bring in. The research work tries to shed light on how decentralized learning can be employed to improve and strengthen clinical research by enabling researchers to analyze diverse insights from heterogeneous data sources. Along with discussing cutting-edge Deep learning architectures for Cancer diagnosis, we show experiments with ``Swarm Learning'' i.e. HPE's decentralized machine-learning platform that facilitates collaboration between data owners. This experiment focuses on Breast Cancer tumor diagnosis. As a part of the study, we examined around 1300 histochemical images of breast cancer tumors as well as follow-up records for multiple cases using various deep learning techniques. The experimental results show that decentralized learning can compete with traditional machine learning and make way for more robust methods in not just cancer research, but the healthcare domain as a whole.",
