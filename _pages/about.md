Hello! I'm a budding Software Engineer with around 1.5 years of experience working primarily as a `Backend Engineer`, at a B2B Sales engagement platform called `Vymo`. 

I've also obtained my Bachelors in Computer Science from `PES University, Bangalore` in the Fall of 2023.

I'm quite passionate about solving problems in the area of scalable and fault tolerant backend `distributed systems`. I'm also interested in getting deep into `Database Internals` and `Big Data Internals`. 

Throughout my career as a Software Developer, I've been involved in all processes of the `Software Development Lifecycle`. At `Vymo` I've had the opportunity to take on the technical ownership of a high-performance, distributed `stream processing microservice`. Here, I improved the performance of the service manifold through various optimizations, closely monitored and ensured 99.9% uptime during all scenarios and implemented various new functional features and enhancements.
