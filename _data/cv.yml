    - title: Member of Technical Staff
      institution: Vymo
      year: Jul'23 - Present
      description:
        - Tech owner for a `distributed stream processing service` written in `Java` and driven by `Kafka`, for allocating sales-data and called as the allocation-service.
        - Decoupled stateful in-memory data from allocation-service and cached them in `Redis`, solving a critical race-condition as well as drastically improving the throughput of the service by 2x.
        - Contributed to a `multi-threaded` high-throughput rule evaluation engine capable of processing 10M+ sales-data per day, as a part of the allocation-service.
        - Performed various optimisations for allocation-service such as improving the `concurrency`, `JVM/GC` tuning and Kafka-consumer optimisations which increased the throughput of the service by `~30%`.
        - Wrote automated scripts for `benchmarking` the performance of the microservice with production like data and traffic.
        - Resolved various concurrency issues and tech-debts in production, bringing down the error count from 150+ errors during high traffic down to 0.
        - Contributed to the lead-management-service by designing and developing a scalable solution for combining customer data from different sources and enabling a consolidated view called as Customer-360.
        - Built a Filter Translation Layer which is responsible for translating user defined search criteria into ElasticSearch queries, thereby drastically expanding the search capabilities of Customer-360.
        - Played a key role as a SME/on-call developer for two areas - customer-360 and allocation-service. Organized KTs, resolved technical debts, triaged bugs and upheld client SLAs.
        - Enhanced various product areas such as sms/email based content-sharing platform, self-service config platform and lead-management workflows mainly implemented in NodeJS, impacting all of the 100+ clients.
    - title: Software Development Intern
      institution: Vyapar
      year: Jan'23 - Jun'23
      description:
        - Contributed to a redesigned data pipeline for ingesting data from MySQL to GCP BigQuery, based on the principles of log replication (change-data-capture) of MySQL binlogs.
        - Reduced the cost of operations involved in transporting data from from MySQL to BigQuery by around 15% as compared to the old ingestion solution.
        - Developed various Microservices and REST APIs using Node.js with TypeScript along with technologies such as AWS S3, Lambda, SQS, MongoDB and Redis.

    - title: Research Mentee
      institution: PES University - Hewlett Packard Enterprise Collaboration
      year: Jan'22 - Aug'22
      description:
        - Identified gaps in the oncology research space where privacy laws prevent different medical organizations from collaborating with each other as patient data is sensitive, under the guidance of Dr Sivaraman E, PESU.
        - Proposed a solution to overcome this by utilizing distributed machine learning and applying privacy-preserving techniques so that only statistical insights are shared among organizations.
        - Collaborated with Hewlett Packard to utilize their distributed privacy preserving machine learning platform called Swarm learning, under the guidance of Mr K L Shastry, HPE
        - Officially contributed to Swarm Learning by developing a Neural Network based model for cancer diagnosis and a DenseNet model for cancer histology image classification, achieving an accuracy of well over 95%.
        - Articulated and published the research paper titled ”Swarm Learning for Oncology Research” in LNCS, Springer.
    - title: Research Intern
      institution: Center for Information Security, Forensics and Cyber Resilience, PESU
      year: Aug'21 - Dec'21
      description:
        - Aimed to close gaps with respect to the applicability of different low light image enhancement techniques for their real-world applications such as digital forensics.
        - Implemented various low light image enhancement technique algorithms based on their corresponding research papers and performed a quantitative and qualitative analysis on the results produced by them, while drawing comparisons.
        - Analysed qualitative factors such as adaptability to different input images, contrast and color-scale of output images and quantitative factors such as PSNR.
        - Articulated and published the research pre-print titled ”Advancements in Low Light Image Enhancement Techniques for Real-Time Applications - A Comprehensive Review” in SSRN, Elsevier; under the guidance of Dr. Sivaraman E, PESU.

    - title: TCP LoadBalancer
      year: 2022
      description: 
      - A simple TCP reverse proxy server responsible for equally distributing consecutive requests to all the servers within a cluster of servers in a round robin fashion in order to increase the throughput of request processing. Tech- C, Socket Programming, POSIX Threads.
    - title: Distributed Key-Value Store
      year: 2023
      description: 
      - Developed a robust distributed key-value store in Go using a memberlist for cluster membership and member failure detection. Multiple instances of the cache can be initialized and a load-balancer can be used to route subsequent requests to shards within the cluster. Tech - Go, MemberList.
    - title: Algorithm Visualizer
      year: 2020
      description: 
      - Developed a robust Web Application in ReactJS capable of visualizing different algorithms such as Sorting and Pathfinding algorithms. For this example, Dijkstra’s algorithm and selection sort were implemented for visualization. Tech - ReactJS, CSS, JavaScript.
